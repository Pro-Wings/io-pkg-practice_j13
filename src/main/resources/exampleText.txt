How long can be implicitly promoted to float in java even long have bigger size than float?

In Java, a long can be implicitly promoted to a float without any issues, even though long has a bigger size than float. This is because both long and float are numeric data types, and Java allows for implicit widening conversions between compatible numeric types.

The long data type is a 64-bit signed integer, while the float data type is a 32-bit floating-point number. When a long value is promoted to a float, it undergoes a conversion that preserves its numerical value within the range supported by float. However, it's important to note that floating-point numbers have limited precision, which means not all long values can be accurately represented as float.

If a long value exceeds the maximum representable value of a float, it will be rounded or truncated to fit within the float range, leading to a potential loss of precision. If you need to ensure no loss of precision, you should use explicit type casting to convert the long to a double, which has a higher precision and a wider range than float.
