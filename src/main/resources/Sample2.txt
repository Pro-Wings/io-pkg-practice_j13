This book is for Java developers and architects interested in develop‐
ing microservices. We start the book with the high-level under‐
standing and fundamental prerequisites that should be in place to be
successful with a microservice architecture. Unfortunately, just
using new technology doesn’t magically solve distributed systems
problems. We take a look at some of the forces involved and what
successful companies have done to make microservices work for
them, including culture, organizational structure, and market pres‐
sures. Then we take a deep dive into a few Java frameworks for
implementing microservices. The accompanying source-code repos‐
itory can be found on GitHub. Once we have our hands dirty, we’ll
come back up for air and discuss issues around deployment, cluster‐
ing, failover, and how Docker and Kubernetes deliver solutions in
these areas. Then we’ll go back into the details with some hands-on
examples with Docker, Kubernetes, and NetflixOSS to demonstrate
the power they bring for cloud-native, microservice architectures.
We finish with thoughts on topics we cannot cover in this small
book but are no less important, like configuration, logging, and con‐
tinuous delivery
